This package provides extended support for our [spatie/enum](https://github.com/spatie/enum) package in Laravel.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-enum
```

## Usage

### Model Attribute casting

Chances are that if you're working in a Laravel project, you'll want to use enums within your models.
This package provides a trait you can use in these models, to allow allow automatic casting between stored enum values and enum objects. 

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Spatie\Enum\Laravel\HasEnums;

class TestModel extends Model
{
    use HasEnums;

    protected $enums = [
        'status' => StatusEnum::class,
    ];
}
```

You can also define enum as nullable:

```php
protected $enums = [
    'status' => StatusEnum::class.':nullable',
];
```

You can also define attribute as array of enums:

```php
protected $enums = [
    'status' => StatusEnum::class.':array',
];
```

By using the `HasEnums` trait, you'll be able to work with the `status` field like so:

```php
$model = new TestModel();
$model->status = StatusEnum::DRAFT();
```

You can set the value of an enum field with its textual value:

```php
$model->status = 'published';
```

This can be useful when filling data from a validated request:

```php
$model->fill($request->validated());

// â€¦

$model->status->isEqual(StatusEnum::ARCHIVED());
``` 

In some cases, enums should be stored as integer (index) in the database.

By using the `$casts` property you can cast your `status` attribute to `int` or `integer` and the trait will store the index instead of the value.

### Model Query Scopes

The `HasEnums` trait also provides some useful scopes to query your database.
These scopes will also take the optional mapping you provided into account.

```php
Post::whereEnum('status', StatusEnum::DRAFT());
Post::whereNotEnum('status', 'published');
Post::whereEnum('status', StatusEnum::DRAFT())->orWhereEnum('status', StatusEnum::PUBLISHED());
```

You may provide multiple enums as an array:

```php
Post::whereEnum('status', [StatusEnum::DRAFT(), StatusEnum::ARCHIVED()]);

Post::whereNotEnum('status', [StatusEnum::PUBLISHED()]);
```

You may also provide textual input:

```php
Post::whereEnum('status', 'archived');
Post::whereEnum('status', 'legacy archived value');
```

### Validation Rules

This package provides some validation rule classes to validate your request data against a given enumerable.

```php
use Spatie\Enum\Laravel\Rules\EnumRule;

$rules = [
    'status' => new EnumRule(StatusEnum::class),
];
```

This rule validates that the value of `status` is any possible representation of the `StatusEnum`.
If you want to check that the value is a possible `name`, `value` or `index` of `StatusEnum`you can use the more specific rules.

```php
use Spatie\Enum\Laravel\Rules\EnumIndexRule;
use Spatie\Enum\Laravel\Rules\EnumNameRule;
use Spatie\Enum\Laravel\Rules\EnumValueRule;

new EnumIndexRule(StatusEnum::class);
new EnumNameRule(StatusEnum::class);
new EnumValueRule(StatusEnum::class);
``` 

But you can also use the simple string validation rule definition:

```php
$rules = [
    'status' => [
        'enum:'.StatusEnum::class,
        'enum_index:'.StatusEnum::class,
        'enum_name:'.StatusEnum::class,
        'enum_value:'.StatusEnum::class,
    ],
];
```

If you want to customize the failed validation messages you can publish the translation file.
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Enum\Laravel\EnumServiceProvider" --tag="translation"
```
We pass several replacements to the translation key which you can use.
* `attribute` - the name of the validated attribute
* `value` - the actual value that's validated
* `enum` - the full class name of the wanted enumerable 
* `other` - a comma separated list of all possible values - they are translated via the `enums` array in the translation file

### Request Data Transformation

A common scenario is that you receive an enumerable value as part of yor request data.
To let you work with it as a real enum object you can transform request data to an enum in a similar way to the model attribute casting.

#### Request macro

There is a request macro available which is the base for the other possible ways to cast request data to an enumerable.

```php
$request->transformEnums($enumCastRules);
```

This is an example definition of all possible request enum castings.
There are three predefined keys available as constants on `Spatie\Enum\Laravel\Http\EnumRequest` to cast enums only in specific request data sets.
All other keys will be treated as independent enum casts and are applied to the combined request data set.

```php
$enums = [
    // cast the status key independent of it's data set
    'status' => StatusEnum::class,
    // cast the status only in the request query params
    EnumRequest::REQUEST_QUERY => [
        'status' => StatusEnum::class,
    ],
    // cast the status only in the request post data
    EnumRequest::REQUEST_REQUEST => [
        'status' => StatusEnum::class,
    ],
    // cast the status only in the request route params
    EnumRequest::REQUEST_ROUTE => [
        'status' => StatusEnum::class,
    ],
];
```

You can call this macro yourself in every part of your code with access to a request instance.
Most commonly you will do this in your controller action if you don't want to use one of the other two ways.

#### Form Requests

Form requests are the easiest way to cast the data to an enum.

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;
use Spatie\Enum\Laravel\Http\Requests\TransformsEnums;

class StatusFormRequest extends FormRequest
{
    use TransformsEnums;

    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [];
    }

    public function enums(): array
    {
        return [
            'status' => StatusEnum::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

The request data transformation is done after validation via the `FormRequest::passedValidation()` method. If you define your own `passedValidation()` method you have to call the request macro `transformEnums()` yourself.

```php
protected function passedValidation()
{
    $this->transformEnums($this->enums());

    // ...
}
```

#### Middleware

You can also use the middleware to transform enums in a more general way and for requests without a form request.

```php
use Spatie\Enum\Laravel\Http\Middleware\TransformEnums;

new TransformEnums([
    'status' => StatusEnum::class,
]);
```

### Enum Make Command

We provide an artisan make command which allows you to quickly create new enumerables.

```bash
php artisan make:enum StatusEnum
```

You can use `--method` or `--value` options to predefine some enum names or values - you can use them several times.
The `--formatter` option is used to let you define the used conversion from value to method.

## Testing

composer test
